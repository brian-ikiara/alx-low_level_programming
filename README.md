#C Programming#

-------------------------------------------------------------------

##SYNOPSIS##

###A little history###

> Was first developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 when it was used to rewrite the UNIX kernel. Was later adopted by Windows 1.0 in 1985, then by Linux in 1991.
> In 1977, Oracle Database Development System was founded and its code was later transcribed in C in 1983.

###Simplest C Program###

> In every programming language, it starts with a simple "Hello World!" which evolves toa monster of a program(especially if you're dealing with DSA(Data Structures & Algorithms))

```c
	#include <stdio.h>
	
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		(void)argc;
		(void)argv;

		printf("Hello World!\n");

		return (0);
	}
```

> Man do I love C! Though it might seem hard, C is quite a caring and affectionate programming language. :satisfied:
