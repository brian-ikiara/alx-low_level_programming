# C Programming

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS

### A little history

Was first developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 when it was used to rewrite the UNIX kernel. Was later adopted by Windows 1.0 in 1985, then by Linux in 1991.
In 1977, Oracle Database Development System was founded and its code was later transcribed in C in 1983.

### Simplest C Program

In every programming language, it starts with a simple "Hello World!" which evolves toa monster of a program(especially if you're dealing with DSA(Data Structures & Algorithms))

```c
	#include <stdio.h>
	
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		(void)argc;
		(void)argv;

		printf("Hello World!\n");

		return (0);
	}
```

## REMARKS

Man do I love C! Though it might seem hard, C is quite a caring and affectionate programming language. :satisfied:
